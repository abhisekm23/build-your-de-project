# Build Your 1st Data Engineering Project (July 2024)

Hi 👋🏻 Have you noticed this repo is empty? Yep, it's for our Co-learning session. So let's make something beautiful in here.

Ready?

## What are we building

In every TheLearningDev session, we will use a pre-existing resource. For this session, we will be using these two resources.

> Don't overwhelm yourself, if you understand nothing, you're in the right place. 

1. https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-projects-with-free-template/
2. https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-project-for-beginners-batch-edition/

## Prepare Yourself

1. If you need to know Python, yes classes level Python. If you don't already it's ok [Keep think Python book](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) next to you at all times
2. You don't have to be a master of anything else, mark the event on your calendar and show up. That's it
3. Notice and ***Remember this is not a bootcamp or your workshop. You can learn at your own pace with check-ins over Zoom.***

## Prepare Your Laptop

1. Install Python
2. Install Docker
3. Clone this repo [Beginner DE Project](https://github.com/josephmachado/beginner_de_project)
4. Visual Studio code or any other code editor ready.

## Finally,
