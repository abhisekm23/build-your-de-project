# Build Your 1st Data Engineering Project (July 2024)

Hi 👋🏻 Have you noticed this repo is empty? Yep, it's for our Co-learning session. So let's make something beautiful in here.

Ready?

## Few things to remember

1. If you need to know Python, yes classes level Python. If you don't already it's ok [Keep think Python book](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) next to you at all times
2. You don't have to be a master of anything else, mark the event on your calendar and show up. That's it
3. Notice and Remember this is not a bootcamp or your workshop. You can learn at your own pace with check-ins over Zoom.

## The Project

In every TheLearningDev session, we will use a pre-existing resource. For this session, we will be using these two resources.

> Don't overwhelm yourself, if you understand nothing, you're in the right place.
